# API Proxy Implementation

This branch implements changes to use the new API Proxy feature in the backend for more reliable communication with external APIs.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `HumanizeText.js` component to use `/api/proxy/humanize_text` endpoint instead of direct API calls
2. Removed direct API URL from environment files (`.env`, `.env.development`, and `.env.example`)
3. Simplified error handling since the proxy handles many common issues

## Required Backend Changes

For this implementation to work, you must first merge the PR in the `version-1---backend` repository that implements the Puppeteer API proxy:

https://github.com/granitevolition/version-1---backend/pull/3

## Railway Deployment Configuration

After merging the backend PR, configure the following in your Railway deployment:

1. In your `version-1---backend` project:
   - Add environment variable: `API_BASE_URL=https://web-production-3db6c.up.railway.app`
   - This should point to the humanizer API base URL (without the `/humanize_text` path)

2. Deploy the backend with the new changes

3. Deploy this frontend branch

## How It Works

The frontend now sends requests to the backend's `/api/proxy/*` endpoint, which:

1. Uses Puppeteer to create a real browser session
2. Makes a browser-based request to the external API
3. Handles JavaScript execution and session management
4. Returns the processed results to the frontend

This approach resolves the "Error: Unexpected response format from server" and "You need to enable JavaScript to run this app" issues by making the requests appear to come from a real browser with JavaScript enabled.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the backend logs in Railway for any errors
2. Verify that the `API_BASE_URL` is correctly set in the backend environment
3. Check the browser debug console for any frontend errors
